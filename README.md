## Find out 

Welcome! :wave:

### What does that even mean?!?

It has been said:

> Fuck around, find out

This meme-friendly colloquialsim is often accompanied by screenshots demonstrating its meaning that when one "fucks around" they are apt to "find out" (via consequences).

So, given this rather negative sounding connotation, why would I use such a phrase for any reason whatsover? 

It's for the ~lulz~ puns, of course! 

@TODO Pun Dog Here, Maybe?

### I'm Eph!

There are ~many~ probably other Ephs, but I'm the only Eph that is me (I'm definitely [not Steve](https://youtu.be/5vtZcojS9KA), despite my given middle name)

As you might have guessed, I was not born Eph Baum

Instead, I was given a name I was told not to use. Directed, instead, to use my middle name. This was fine enough as my given first name easily conformed to joke. Even though I generally didn't use that name, if a bully found it out, it would invariably be used against me. My middle name was not great either as it used a less common, less popular, spelling of a very common name ultimately leading to additional teasing. Finally there's my given last name, which I actually don't hate, it's just one of those long German last names being 10 letters long.

#### F19baum, F21baum with spaces

Between the first letter of my first name: F, and the end of my last name: baum, there are 19 letters; there are twenty-one if you include non-printing characters.

These two points, however, have become commonly picked upon for a "nickname": 

F-baum

#### Hello F. | F., I hope this message finds you well!

> It's Eph, actually

For years I have used my first initial for most systems and frequently found that it's pretty common that systems aren't build for a traditional `first_name` + " " + `last_name` expectation.

I have thousands of emails addressed to F.


## You've Explained Your Clever Name, but What is Eph Around?

As of yet it remains nothing, but ultimately it's meant to be _something_

... stay tuned (and this might not be like all my other abandoned ideas :sweat_smile:)
