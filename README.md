# Eph Around

## Find out 

### What does that even mean?!?

It has been said:

> Fuck around, find out

This meme-friendly colloquialsim is often accompanied by screenshots demonstrating its meaning that when one "fucks around" ther are apt to "find out" (the consequences).

So, given this rather negative sounding connotation, why would I use such a phrase for any reason whatsover? 

It's for the ~lulz~ puns, of course!

### I'm Eph!

There are ~many~ probably other Ephs, but I'm the only Eph that is me

As you might have guessed, I was not born Eph Baum

Instead, I was given a name I was told not to use. Directed, instead, to use my middle name. This was fine as my first name was easy to make fun of and even though I generally didn't use it, if a bully found it out, it would be used against me. My middle name was not great, and it used a less common, less popular, spelling that resulted in more teasing ultimately. Finally there's my given last name, which I actually don't hate, it's just long as heck. 

#### F19baum, F21baum with spaces

Between the first letter of my first name: F, and the end of my last name: baum, there are 19 letters; there are twenty-one if you include non-printing characters.

These two points, however, have become commonly picked upon for a "nickname": 

F-baum

... probably this is enough to prove my theory that this file will be concatenated with the `index.md` file - this Jekyll voodoo will not defeat me.
